Errors Tracker

Function `initErrorsTracker` from `index.js` will collect errors from your web-site.

Use example in `index.html` to integrate it to your web-site.

Also you need to run server from `server.js` to proxy errors to Telegram.

```sh
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" CHAT_ID="YOUR_CHAT_ID" npm run server
```
